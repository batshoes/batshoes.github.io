    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! <br><br>
      I am glad you made it all the way here. <br>
      It's a long way from the good part of the internet. I guess after all your hard work you'd like to know a little bit about me. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is James.
      <br>
       I moved to New York in April 2015 from Sydney, Australia. I like to write code and things. I started writing a book, but I wasn't sure what it was supposed to be about. So I'm still working on it. I have been trying to write more and almost have a full storyboard. Did you know that almost is the longest word you can write whilst keeping all the letters alphabetical?
    </p>


    <p>
      I also do a lot of coding. I am proficient in Ruby on Rails, and am available for hire. 
      <br>
      Like an outlaw. <br><br>
      You can learn more on the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section of the website.
