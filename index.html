      <h1>James Middlemiss</h1>
      <p>
        G'day. I'm James Middlemiss. I'm a software engineer with primary focus on <span class="highlight">Ruby on Rails</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent my weekdays as a <span class="highlight job-description">Senior Backend Engineer</span> building new features with strong TDD protocol. 
        Integrating and consuming third party API's with some of Australia's largest brands. I've been doing this for 6 years now, and don't
        see any signs of slowing down. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        The rest of my time is spent divided amoungst various interests. I like <span class="highlight interest-learning">learning new things</span>, 
        in particular, different programming languages and how things function. Figuring out how to take something apart, put it back together, and have it
        just <em>work</em> is intoxicating.
        When I have the time, I really enjoy <span class="highlight interest-gaming">video games</span>. Who doesn't? I think that the best games can
        be extraordinarily immersive and interactive experiences that can be as vivid and lasting as any book or movie.
        I sometimes <span class="highlight interest-writing">write silly stories and songs</span> for my daughter, Georgia, about her toys and friends. 
        She's the best kid I've met, and that's totally unbiased. Straight facts.
        <span class="highlight interest-books">Reading</span> expands the mind when travel is impermissible. You can project yourself across the world in 
        an instant with the right reading material, and I take every opportunity I can to do just that.
        I love <span class="highlight">all things food</span> and live in one of the best neighbourhoods to capitalise on local haunts. Always searching 
        for the next tasty morsel, I'm always keen to try anything and everything. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you 
        <ul class="list">
          <li>have got something you'd like me to build. (I love a side hustle)</li>
          <li>have a high score you think I can't beat. (There was a time I could run the Luigi Raceway in Mario Kart 64 Blindfolded in under 2.5 minutes)</li>
          <li>have a kid with a toy you think I could write a silly story about. (The puppy with toilet roll legs - and other exciting adventures)</li>
          <li>have a recommendation for a restuarant you think is just extraordinary. (<a href="https://www.bistecca.com.au/" class="highlight">Bistecca</a>)</li>
          <li>just want to have a chat about something from above. (if you have news about Breath of the Wild 2, I <em>need</em> to speak with you)</li>
