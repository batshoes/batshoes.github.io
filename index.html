    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! <br><br>
      I am glad you made it all the way here. <br>
      It's a long way from the good part of the internet. I guess after all your hard work you'd like to know a little bit about me. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is James.
      <br>
       I moved to New York in April 2015 from Sydney, Australia. I like to write code and things. I started writing a book, but I wasn't sure what it was supposed to be about. So I'm still working on it. I have been trying to write more and almost have a full storyboard. Did you know that almost is the longest word you can write whilst keeping all the letters alphabetical?
    </p>


    <p>
      I also do a lot of coding. I am proficient in Ruby on Rails, and am available for hire. <br>
      <br>
      Like an outlaw. <br>
      <br>
      But enough about that. You can learn more on the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section of the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some other things that you should know about me are: 
      <ul>
        <li>I like the outside</li>
        <li>I am pretty pale, and cant really handle the outside</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>I like wine and scotch</li>
        <li>I prefer both neat, and don't really know if wine comes any other way.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>I like comic books and their respective films</li>
        <li>I thought the Dark Knight Rises was a terrible rendition</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>I like really nice photographs</li>
        <li>I have no idea what makes a photograph really nice. I just know I like some.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
