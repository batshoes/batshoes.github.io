      <h1>James Middlemiss</h1>
      <p>
        G'day. I'm James Middlemiss. I'm a software engineer with primary focus on <span class="highlight">Ruby on Rails</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend my weekdays as a <span class="highlight job-description">Senior Backend Engineer</span> building new features with strong TDD protocol. 
        Integrating and consuming third party API's with some of Australia's largest brands. I've been doing this for 8 years now, and am loving every minute. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        <!-- Rest of Time blurb -->
        The rest of my time is spent divided amoungst various interests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- New Things -->
        I like seeing how things work, particularly different programming solutions to varied problems and gadgets I can take apart. Figuring out how something works by
        deconstructing and rebuilding it, either digitally or physically, is super gratifying and drives me to do my job better.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Books -->
        <span class="highlight interest-books">Reading</span> expands the world when travel is impermissible. The right book can transport you to another 
        world in an instant or provide perspectives unobtainable otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Vidya Games -->
        When I have the time, I really enjoy <span class="highlight interest-gaming">video games</span>. Who doesn't? I think that the best games can
        be immersive and vivid as the best books or films.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Georgia -->
        I sometimes <span class="highlight interest-writing">write silly stories and songs</span> for my daughters, Georgia and Sophie. They're the best kids I've met, and that's totally unbiased. Straight facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- Food -->
        I love <span class="highlight interest-food">all things food</span> and live in one of the best neighbourhoods to capitalise on local haunts. Forever searching 
        for the next tasty morsel, I can't wait to anything new and exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you 
        <ul class="list">
          <li>have got something you'd like me to <span class="highlight contact-build">build</span>.</li>
          <li>have a <span class="highlight contact-highscore">high score</span> you think I can't beat.</li>
          <li>have a kid with a toy you think I could write a <span class="highlight contact-story">silly story</span> about.</li>
          <li>have a <span class="highlight contact-recommendations">recommendation</span> for a book/movie/city/restuarant/person/tree/animal/gadget/tradie you think is just extraordinary.</li>
          <li>just want to have a <span class="highlight contact-chat">chat</span> about something from above.</li>
